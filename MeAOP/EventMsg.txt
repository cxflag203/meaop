EventId(MsgId)

how to pass the event parameters?


Event Driven Architecture，EDA = Message Driven Architecture, MDA

(1) an activity that happens (一个发生的活动)
(2) something that represents that activity in a computer system (计算机系统里面代表某个活动的事物)

Luckham和Shulte将“复杂事件”定义成“一个对多个其它子事件的抽象的事件。


Multi-Events Supports:
  original envent message dispatch:
    hook the dispatch method.
    
    GMeEvent.addListener(aEventId, aObj, aHandler);
    One MeEvent only response one kind of eventId.
      I will keep the publishers(aObj), EventHandler(aHandler).
      FEventId:
      FPublishers:
        Publisher, EventHandler1, EventHandler2...
        Publisher, EventHandler1, EventHandler2...
      
    GMeClickEvent.addListener(aObj, aHandler);
       GMeEvent.addListener(ClickEventId, aObj, aHandler);
       

  TSupported : can use the AOP inject the class to suport the event?
  TMeEventHelper = 
    FSubscribers

  TObject = Class(TXXXObject, IPublisher);
  protected
    //IPublisher methods?
  public
  end;

;Event (event object, event message, event tuple): An object that represents, encodes, or records an event, 
generally for the purpose of computer processing.

event object lifetime: from event start to event end.
   1. Events are processed by computer systems by processing their representations as event objects. 
      The same activity may be represented by more than one event object; each event object might 
      record different attributes of the activity. In many event processing systems, for example 
      simulation systems, events are immutable. In such systems, a modification or transformation 
      of an event must be achieved by creating a new event object and not by altering the original 
      event. Deletion would entail removing an event from further processing.
   2. Overloading: Event objects contain data. The word -event is overloaded so that it can be used 
      as a synonym for event object. In discussing event processing, the word -event is used to denote 
      both the everyday meaning (anything that happens) and the computer science meaning (an event object 
      or message). The context of each use indicates which meaning is intended.
